Introduction
In this assessment, you will review a requirements document and propose a software solution. Your submission will showcase what you have learned in the course through the creation of a design and test plan, which is a deliverable for the Agile methodology. Review the scenario, requirements, and rubric below for additional guidance as you complete this assessment.



For this task, you will act as the project lead for MJ Logistics Gaming Company, a medium-sized company. You may choose to implement a customizable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system, or you may decide to have the system custom-built. When making this decision, ensure all requirements are considered and can be implemented if choosing a COTS system. If you decide to build the system, consider the additional resources that will be needed. Review the attached “CRM Requirements” supporting document to gain an overall understanding of the system that the company is looking for. Use the “Design Template” supporting document to submit your proposal.

Scenario
You are the project lead of a software development team for a project at MJ Logistics Gaming Company. The team includes business analysts, solution analysts, developers, quality assurance professionals, and a project manager, among other team members. You have been tasked with presenting a solution proposal and design and test plan with the help of your team to support the software development process. MJ Logistics Gaming also wants your team to implement a web-based customer relationship management (CRM) system for the sales force of a medium-sized company. MJ Logistics Gaming has provided a high-level requirements document to aid you in identifying an appropriate solution and gaining an overall understanding of the system the company is looking for. (See the attached “CRM Requirements.”)

Requirements
Your submission must represent your original work and understanding of the course material. Most performance assessment submissions are automatically scanned through the WGU similarity checker. Students are strongly encouraged to wait for the similarity report to generate after uploading their work and then review it to ensure Academic Authenticity guidelines are met before submitting the file for evaluation. See Understanding Similarity Reports for more information.  

Grammarly Note: 
Professional Communication will be automatically assessed through Grammarly for Education in most performance assessments before a student submits work for evaluation. Students are strongly encouraged to review the Grammarly for Education feedback prior to submitting work for evaluation, as the overall submission will not pass without this aspect passing. See Use Grammarly for Education Effectively for more information.  

Microsoft Files Note: 
Write your paper in Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) unless another Microsoft product, or pdf, is specified in the task directions. Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc.  All supporting documentation, such as screenshots and proof of experience, should be collected in a pdf file and submitted separately from the main file. For more information, please see Computer System and Technology Requirements.  

 

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.
